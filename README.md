# Water-Quality-Prediction-using-RF-SVM

This project uses Machine Learning models to predict water quality based on environmental parameters like pH, turbidity, and temperature. It helps in monitoring water safety and supports public health decisions through real-time predictions.

# 🔍 Project Overview

---> Goal: Predict water quality using machine learning for better environmental monitoring.

---> Models Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest

---> Data: Simulated/real CSV datasets with features like pH, turbidity, temperature

---> Outcome: Classify water as safe or unsafe based on trained ML models

# 🛠 Features

---> Trained and evaluated SVM and Random Forest models

---> Visualized model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

---> Applied predictive analytics to support environmental decisions

---> Hands-on experimentation with different hyperparameters
